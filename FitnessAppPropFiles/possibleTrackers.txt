Steps and Distance: Fitness trackers often use built-in accelerometers to count the number of steps taken and calculate the distance covered throughout the day. This data provides insights into a person's activity level and can help set goals for increasing daily movement.

Heart Rate: Many fitness trackers include optical sensors that measure heart rate. Tracking heart rate can provide information about a person's cardiovascular health, exercise intensity, and recovery.

Calorie Burn: Fitness trackers estimate the number of calories burned based on factors like age, weight, heart rate, and activity level. This data helps users understand their energy expenditure during workouts and throughout the day.

Sleep Monitoring: Some fitness trackers offer sleep tracking capabilities to monitor the quality and duration of sleep. This data can help users optimize their sleep patterns and identify areas for improvement.

Activity and Exercise Tracking: Fitness trackers can recognize and categorize different types of physical activities, such as walking, running, cycling, or swimming. They may provide summaries of activity duration, intensity, and calories burned during specific exercises.

GPS Tracking: Many fitness tracker applications incorporate GPS technology to track outdoor activities accurately. This enables users to monitor their route, pace, elevation, and distance for activities like running, hiking, or cycling.

Goals and Challenges: Fitness tracker apps often allow users to set personal goals, such as a step count or exercise duration target, and provide motivation through progress tracking and achievements. Some apps also offer challenges or competitions to engage users and encourage healthy competition.

Health Metrics: Advanced fitness trackers may measure additional health metrics like blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), stress levels, menstrual cycle tracking, or even ECG (electrocardiogram) readings. These features provide users with more comprehensive health insights.
